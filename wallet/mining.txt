How to mine  from the wallet(QT client).(CPU mine)

1. Open Wallet.
2. Choose Help.
3. Select Debug window.
4. Select Console.
5. Type “setgenerate true -1” to use all processing cores.

Note : If you want to use 2 / 4/ 6 cores then use “setgenerate true 4” command to use 4 cores (change the number if u need to)
       If you want end mining type "setgenerate true 0".

Next step:Now you have to check if your client is mining or not, just type “getmininginfo” command  in that same window,
          you should start to see your hashespersec reported as following.


{
"blocks" : 7750,
"currentblocksize" : 1000,
"currentblocktx" : 0,
"difficulty" : 0.00955156,
"errors" : "",
"generate" : true,
"genproclimit" : -1,
"hashespersec" : 573,
"networkhashps" : 7380675,
"pooledtx" : 0,
"testnet" : false
}


Now you should start to see your hashespersec reported, if hashespersec is not zero, you’re doing it right.

You can also check some other stats with following commands.
